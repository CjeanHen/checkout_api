# Checkout
Inspired by weekly exit tickets, checkout is an easy way to make a questionaire to get feedback from students or team members. Anyone can create a survey, but only the survey owner can edit, delete or view responses to the questions. All response submits are final. It is easy to view all of the responses below each question and allows you to quickly guage your audience's feedback.

## Planning Story
I was unsure of how to approach this project at first. When thinking about tables and resources I wasn't sure how much I needed to break down each question. Ultimately, I ended up with a user, survey, question and answer table. Doing this allowed me greater flexibility when thinking of how to retrieve and display data, and in hindsight I think it was the right choice. Since this was my first time working with an SQL database I was worried about the rigidness of the models, but for this project it wasn't a problem as I could easily modify the models throughout my development process. This would not be the case in a large scale application, as there could be negative side effects for the existing data.

The front end was really fun to build. I think I did a good job keeping the components modular, but I think I should revisit the ShowSurvey module and try to break it down even smaller. I feel like I have a strong grasp on the concepts used in this app and am inspired to seek out more advanced understanding and utilization of React. The styling is nothing exceptional, but this is the first independent project in which I attempted to add a personal touch. I think the cleaner websites are more on-brand for me.
